### "The show must go on."

**wxPython 4.0.3** is now available at 
[PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/wxPython/4.0.3/), with some 
additional files at the 
[Extras archive](https://extras.wxPython.org/wxPython4/extras/).

This is another quick turn-around release in order to solve a couple
semi-serious issues found in 4.0.2. Changes in this release include the following:

<!-- TEASER_END -->

* Fixed a linking problem on macOS. The new waf added an explicit link to the
  Python shared library which meant that it would try to load it at runtime,
  even if a different Python (such as Anaconda, EDM or Homebrew) was used to
  import wxPython. This, of course, caused runtime errors. ([#892](https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/issues/892))

* Sort pages by dock_pos when added to automatic (agw.aui) notebook. ([#882](https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/issues/882))

* Fix a bug in py.introspect.getTokens. ([#889](https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/issues/889))

* Added Vagrant configuration for Fedora-28. Removed Fedora-23 ([#884](https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/issues/884))

* Added wrappers for the wx.WindowIDRef class and added the wx.NewIdRef
  function. These will make it possible to create reserved Window IDs using the
  same mechanism which is used when passing wx.ID_ANY to a widget constructor.
  The object returned by wx.NewIdRef will automatically convert to an int when
  passing it to a window constructor, and can also be used as the source in a
  Bind(). ([#896](https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/issues/896))

* Fixed issue when sys.prefix is not unicode (Python2) and when its contents 
  are not translatable to utf-8.
