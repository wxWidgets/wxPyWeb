Hi all,

Once again I find myself in between full-time employment, and so, once again, I'm informing the wxPython community about it in case anybody knows of opportunities that might be a good fit for me. I'm sure you all have a good idea of my qualifications, but if you need more details please contact me directly. I'm open to direct-hire, contract, or contract-to-hire opportunities. Preferably as a remote worker.

Until the next full-time gig comes along, I'm also open to smaller, one-off wxPython-related jobs. Either some feature or fix within wxPython itself that you want to ensure shows up in a near-future release, or helping out with your own projects using wxPython.

I can be contacted about possible opportunities either by email, or via a direct message at `Discuss wxPython <https://discuss.wxpython.org/>`_.


Thanks! :html:`<br>`
Robin
