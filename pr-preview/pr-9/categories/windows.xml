&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://whyteboard.org/"&gt;Whyteboard&lt;/a&gt;, a useful application written using
wxPython for the GUI, was just
&lt;a href="http://sourceforge.net/blog/whyteboard-aids-in-teachable-moments/"&gt;noticed&lt;/a&gt;
over at SourceForge.  Congrats Sproaty!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Development</category><category>Linux</category><category>Mac</category><category>Software</category><category>Windows</category><guid>https://wxpython.org/blog/whyteboard-gets-noticed/index.html</guid><pubDate>Thu, 03 Jun 2010 09:03:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Time to kick myself again</title><link>https://wxpython.org/blog/time-to-kick-myself-again/index.html</link><dc:creator>Robin</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ever have one of those moments when you see some product or service and
you think, "&lt;em&gt;Doh! I should have thought of that!&lt;/em&gt;" because it is
something that makes so much sense to you that you can't believe that
you hadn't invented it yourself long before?  Well I had one of those
moments today with &lt;a href="https://www.getdropbox.com/"&gt;Dropbox&lt;/a&gt;.  Dropbox is a
cool service that integrates versioned shared storage on a centralized
server with your Mac, Windows or Linux desktops.  Syncronizing files
between your computers, whereever they are located, is as simple as
dragging the files into your dropbox.  New or changed files are
automatically replicated to your dropbox on the other computers.  If
existing files are changed then only the deltas are transported across
the wire, in a rsync-like fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides the simple file sharing among your own computers, there are some
other nice features there too.  Files are private by default, but there
is a Public folder where you can put files you want to share with
others, and you can easily get a public URL for them to paste into
emails or IM messages.  You can also create a shared folder that you
share with other Dropbox users.  Any changes you make in your shared
folder are instantly updated to the other users' copy of the shared
folder, and their changes are replicated back to you. In addition to all
of that, you can easily get back to prior versions of changed files, and
you can undelete files that have been deleted.  And as if that wasn't
enough, there is another special folder type that is an automatic photo
gallery, you just need to drag the photos you want to share to a Photos
folder and the rest is automatic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You get 2GB of space for free, and you can get up to 50GB for $10 per
month or $99 per year.  If you sign up with this &lt;a href="https://www.getdropbox.com/referrals/NTcyNzI1NTk"&gt;referal
link&lt;/a&gt; then you and I
will both get an extra 250MB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, here is the real kicker:  The Dropbox user interface (setup
wizard, preferences dialog, task bar icon, etc.) is written in
wxPython!  If the user ID I saw when I signed up is related in some way
to the number of users (it is just a number so that may be possible)
then that means that there are about three quarters of a million users
running a wxPython application on their computers and they may not even
know it.  Good job guys, I'm impressed!&lt;/p&gt;
