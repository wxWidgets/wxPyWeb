<p> wxPython is a <b>GUI toolkit</b> for the <a
href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> programming language.  It
allows Python programmers to create programs with a robust, highly
functional graphical user interface, simply and easily.  It is
implemented as a Python extension module (native code) that wraps the
popular <a href="http://wxwidgets.org/">wxWidgets</a> cross platform
GUI library, which is written in C++.

<p> Like Python and wxWidgets, wxPython is <b>Open Source</b> which
means that it is free for anyone to use and the source code is
available for anyone to look at and modify.  Or anyone can contribute
fixes or enhancements to the project.

<p> wxPython is a <b>cross-platform</b> toolkit.  This means that the
same program will run on multiple platforms without modification.
Currently supported platforms are 32-bit Microsoft Windows, most Unix
or unix-like systems, and Macintosh OS X.

<p> Since the language is Python, wxPython programs are <b>simple,
easy</b> to write and easy to understand.  <a
