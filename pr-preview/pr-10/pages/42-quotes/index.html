    <p>Here' a few (if "42" can be considered "a few") of the awesomly quirky quotes
from HG2G.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>There is a theory which states that if ever anyone discovers exactly
what the Universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly disappear
and be replaced by something even more bizarre and inexplicable. There
is another theory which states that this has already happened.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many were increasingly of the opinion that they’d all made a big mistake
in coming down from the trees in the first place. And some said that
even the trees had been a bad move, and that no one should ever have
left the oceans.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“My doctor says that I have a malformed public-duty gland and a natural
deficiency in moral fibre,” Ford muttered to himself, “and that I am
therefore excused from saving Universes.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Funny,” he intoned funereally, “how just when you think life can’t
possibly get any worse it suddenly does.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“You know,” said Arthur, “it’s at times like this, when I’m trapped in a
Vogon airlock with a man from Betelgeuse, and about to die of
asphyxiation in deep space that I really wish I’d listened to what my
mother told me when I was young.”<br>“Why, what did she tell you?”<br>
“I don’t know, I didn’t listen.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Space,” it says, “is big. Really big. You just won’t believe how
vastly, hugely, mindbogglingly big it is. I mean, you may think it’s a
long way down the road to the chemist’s, but that’s just peanuts to
space.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ships hung in the sky in much the same way that bricks don’t.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Isn’t it enough to see that a garden is beautiful without having to
believe that there are fairies at the bottom of it too?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A common mistake that people make when trying to design something
completely foolproof is to underestimate the ingenuity of complete
fools.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Curiously enough, the only thing that went through the mind of the bowl
of petunias as it fell was Oh no, not again. Many people have
speculated that if we knew exactly why the bowl of petunias had thought
that we would know a lot more about the nature of the Universe than we
do now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The reason why it was published in the form of a micro sub meson
electronic component is that if it were printed in normal book form, an
interstellar hitchhiker would require several inconveniently large
buildings to carry it around in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For instance, on the planet Earth, man had always assumed that he was
more intelligent than dolphins because he had achieved so much — the
wheel, New York, wars and so on — whilst all the dolphins had ever done
was muck about in the water having a good time. But conversely, the
dolphins had always believed that they were far more intelligent than
man — for precisely the same reasons.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The last ever dolphin message was misinterpreted as a surprisingly
sophisticated attempt to do a double-backwards-somersault through a
hoop whilst whistling the ‘Star Spangled Banner’, but in fact the
message was this: <em>So long and thanks for all the fish.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The chances of finding out what’s really going on in the universe are
so remote, the only thing to do is hang the sense of it and keep
yourself occupied.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Listen, three eyes,” he said, “don’t you try to outweird me, I get
stranger things than you free with my breakfast cereal.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Forty-two,” said Deep Thought, with infinite majesty and calm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not unnaturally, many elevators imbued with intelligence and
precognition became terribly frustrated with the mindless business of
going up and down, up and down, experimented briefly with the notion of
going sideways, as a sort of existential protest, demanded
participation in the decision-making process and finally took to
squatting in basements sulking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Total Perspective Vortex derives its picture of the whole Universe
on the principle of extrapolated matter analyses. To explain — since
every piece of matter in the Universe is in some way affected by every
other piece of matter in the Universe, it is in theory possible to
extrapolate the whole of creation — every sun, every planet, their
orbits, their composition and their economic and social history from,
say, one small piece of fairy cake. The man who invented the Total
Perspective Vortex did so basically in order to annoy his wife.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Shee, you guys are so unhip it’s a wonder your bums don’t fall off.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is known that there are an infinite number of worlds, simply because
there is an infinite amount of space for them to be in. However, not
every one of them is inhabited. Therefore, there must be a finite
number of inhabited worlds. Any finite number divided by infinity is as
near to nothing as makes no odds, so the average population of all the
planets in the Universe can be said to be zero. From this it follows
that the population of the whole Universe is also zero, and that any
people you may meet from time to time are merely the products of a
deranged imagination.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The disadvantages involved in pulling lots of black sticky slime from
out of the ground where it had been safely hidden out of harm’s way,
turning it into tar to cover the land with, smoke to fill the air with
and pouring the rest into the sea, all seemed to outweigh the
advantages of being able to get more quickly from one place to another.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make it totally clear that this gun has a right end and a wrong end.
Make it totally clear to anyone standing at the wrong end that things
are going badly for them. If that means sticking all sort of spikes and
prongs and blackened bits all over it then so be it. This is not a gun
for hanging over the fireplace or sticking in the umbrella stand, it is
a gun for going out and making people miserable with.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is a well known fact that those people who most want to rule people
are, ipso facto, those least suited to do it. To summarize the summary:
anyone who is capable of getting themselves made President should on no
account be allowed to do the job.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Since we decided a few weeks ago to adopt the leaf as legal tender, we
have, of course, all become immensely rich.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the end, it was the Sunday afternoons he couldn’t cope with, and
that terrible listlessness that starts to set in about 2:55, when you
know you’ve taken all the baths that you can usefully take that day,
that however hard you stare at any given paragraph in the newspaper you
will never actually read it, or use the revolutionary new pruning
technique it describes, and that as you stare at the clock the hands
will move relentlessly on to four o’clock, and you will enter the long
dark teatime of the soul.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He gazed keenly into the distance and looked as if he would quite like
the wind to blow his hair back dramatically at that point, but the wind
was busy fooling around with some leaves a little way off.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“He was staring at the instruments with the air of one who is trying to
convert Fahrenheit to centigrade in his head while his house is burning
down.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is a moment in every dawn when light floats, there is the
possibility of magic. Creation holds its breath.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“You may not instantly see why I bring the subject up, but that is
because my mind works so phenomenally fast, and I am at a rough
estimate thirty billion times more intelligent than you. Let me give
you an example. Think of a number, any number.”  “Er, five,” said the
mattress.  “Wrong,” said Marvin. “You see?”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is an art, it says, or rather, a knack to flying. The knack lies
in learning how to throw yourself at the ground and miss.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is a mistake to think you can solve any major problems just with
potatoes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He hoped and prayed that there wasn’t an afterlife. Then he realized
there was a contradiction involved here and merely hoped that there
wasn’t an afterlife.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eskimos had over two hundred different words for snow, without which
their conversation would probably have got very monotonous. So they
would distinguish between thin snow and thick snow, light snow and
heavy snow, sludgy snow, brittle snow, snow that came in flurries, snow
that came in drifts, snow that came in on the bottom of your neighbor’s
boots all over your nice clean igloo floor, the snows of winter, the
snows of spring, the snows you remember from your childhood that were
so much better than any of your modern snow, fine snow, feathery snow,
hill snow, valley snow, snow that falls in the morning, snow that falls
at night, snow that falls all of a sudden just when you were going out
fishing, and snow that despite all your efforts to train them, the
huskies have pissed on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The storm had now definitely abated, and what thunder there was now
grumbled over more distant hills, like a man saying “And another
thing…”  twenty minutes after admitting he’s lost the argument.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He was wrong to think he could now forget that the big, hard, oily,
dirty, rainbow-hung Earth on which he lived was a microscopic dot on a
microscopic dot lost in the unimaginable infinity of the Universe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“It seemed to me,” said Wonko the Sane, “that any civilization that had
so far lost its head as to need to include a set of detailed
instructions for use in a packet of toothpicks, was no longer a
civilization in which I could live and stay sane.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Nothing travels faster than the speed of light, with the possible
exception of bad news, which obeys its own special laws.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I love deadlines. I like the whooshing sound they make as they fly by.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I may not have gone where I intended to go, but I think I have ended up
where I needed to be.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All you really need to know for the moment is that the universe is a
lot more complicated than you might think, even if you start from a
position of thinking it’s pretty damn complicated in the first place.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the beginning the Universe was created. This has made a lot of
people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don’t Panic.</p>
</li>
