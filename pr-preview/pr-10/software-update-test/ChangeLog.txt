Recent changes for the SuperDoodle application
==============================================

This is not a real change-log, but rather serves as an example that goes
along with SuperDoodle's example of self-updating functionality. To see it
in action download and unzip either the Windows or Mac version of
SuperDoodle 1.0.0 from http://wxPython.org/software-update-test/. When you
run the 1.0.0 version there will be a "Check for Updates..." item on the
help menu that you can use to see how the self-updating UI works. The
application will download the latest version available, install it, and
will restart SuperDoodle for you. Be sure to check the version numbers in
the About dialog before and after the update so you can see that it is
changing. (That is the only real change in each of the application
updates.)

And now we return you to the totally fake change log, already in
progress...
