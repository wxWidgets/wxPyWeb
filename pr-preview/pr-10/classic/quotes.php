Here's what people are saying about wxPython...

<p>
<ul>

<b>"Why the hell hasn't wxPython become the standard GUI for Python yet?"</b><br>
<div align="right">-- Eric S. Raymond </div>

<p>
<b>wxPython is the best and most mature cross-platform GUI toolkit, given a 
number of constraints.  The only reason wxPython isn't the standard 
Python GUI toolkit is that Tkinter was there first.</b><br>
<div align="right">-- Guido van Rossum</div>

<p>
<b>"Tkinter is dead, Java is dead, wxPython rules! That's all there is to say."</b><br>
<div align="right">-- Robert Roebling </div>

<p>
<b>"I've written some rather involved applications with Python/Tkinter.  wxPython beats it hands down...  The widgets are better (being based on GTK for Linux) and the class setup is immediately useable.  wxPython gives me a good reason to never even worry about using Java."</b><br>
<div align="right">-- Aaron Rhodes</div>

<p>
<b>"The Python community needs to give up on Tcl and come join us.  wxPython is wonderful stuff."</b><br>
<div align="right">-- David Priest</div>


<p>
<b>"BTW, great work! I've definitively switched from Tk.  I work on Win32, anybody who works on Win32 should switch!"</b><br>
<div align="right">-- Michel Orengo</div>

<p>
<b>I have just picked myself up off the floor having looked at the wxHTML stuff in the new beta!  wxPython is moving from <i><u>excellent</u></i> to <i><u>completely awesome</u></i> very quickly indeed.
</b><br>
<div align="right">-- Sean McGrath</div>

<p>
<b>Thanks for such fantastic work on wxPython.  As a newcomer to
Python the power of this GUI library blows me away.  I will never
use anything else.
</b><br>
<div align="right">-- Mark Evans</div>

<p>
<b>This toolkit has transformed the way I work. 
</b><br>
