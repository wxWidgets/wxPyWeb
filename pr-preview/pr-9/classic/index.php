<li><i>(16-April-2017)</i> <b>wxPython 4.0.0a1</b> is now available on <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/wxPython/4.0.0a1">PyPI</a>. This is the first official release of the new Phoenix version of wxPython, including support for Python 2.7 and 3.4+, installation from PyPI, fully self-contained and relocatable so it can be installed in virtual environments, etc.

<p>More updates to this website are forthcoming, but in the meantime you can learn more about this new release in the <a href="https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/blob/master/README.rst">README</a> and <a href="https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix/blob/master/CHANGES.rst">CHANGES</a> documents, as well as the <a href="https://wxpython.org/Phoenix/docs/html/MigrationGuide.html">Migration Guide</a> and the new <a href="https://wxpython.org/Phoenix/docs/html/main.html">API reference</a> documentation.
</li>

<p><li><i>(Summer 2016)</i> The <b>wxPython Phoenix</b> train is back on the tracks and moving forward at full steam ahead! 

<p><i>"Phoenix"</i> is the code name of the next generation of the wxPython project.  The primary goals of the project are to make it much easier&mdash;through increased automation&mdash;to develop, maintain, and enhance wxPython in the future, and to remove old hacks and other cruft that are no longer needed and which tends to cause confusion for new users. The secondary goals are to make wxPython <i>"...better, stronger, faster."</i> than he was before.

<p>While Phoenix is currently in a pre-alpha state, it is already in a very usable state and many people are already using it in their projects.  You can download binary wheels for Python 2.7 and 3.[45] on Windows and OSX from the <a href="https://wxpython.org/Phoenix/snapshot-builds/">snapshots folder</a>. Be sure to check the <a href="https://wxpython.org/Phoenix/snapshot-builds/README.txt">README</a> file there for more details about what is there and how to use it.  Alpha #1 is on the horizon, at which point Phoenix will start being available directly from PyPI.

<p>If you want to learn more about Phoenix or to help with the effort, please join the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/wxpython-dev">wxPython-dev group</a>.  You can also track development or submit PRs at the <a href="https://github.com/wxWidgets/Phoenix">Phoenix GitHub project</a>.  

<p>Finally, members of the wxPython community have joined together to make pledges towards a bounty reward for the completion of the Phoenix release, with the primary goal of jump-starting development.  If you are interested in making a pledge, please read this <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/wxpython-users/-ey4AysT9ao/UYTh4TuSBQAJ">message thread</a> and contact David Hughes. No actual money will be requested or transferred until the release is completed.

Details are in the <a href="recentchanges.php">Recent Changes</a> document.</li><p>

<p></p><li><i>(23-July-2011)</i> Two at once! Both <b>wxPython 2.8.12.1</b> and <b>wxPython 2.9.2.1</b> have been released.  2.9.2.1 is the next iteration from the wxPython development <a href="http://wiki.wxpython.org/ReleaseSeries">release series</a>, and 2.8.12.1 contains a minor, but important bug fix in the Bind method. </li><p>

<li><i>(19-April-2011)</i> <b>wxPython 2.8.12.0</b> This is a new release from the 2.8 stable <a href="http://wiki.wxpython.org/ReleaseSeries">release series</a>.  No major features or enhancements have been added to the core library, so this release is mostly bug fixes in both the C++ and Python parts of the project, plus some enhancements in the wx.lib package. </li><p>

<li><i>(9-Dec-2010)</i> <b>wxPython 2.8 Application Development Cookbook</b> by Cody Precord is published and <a href="#wxPyCookbook">available</a> for purchase.</li><p>

<li><i>(22-May-2009)</i> The wx and wxPython mail lists are moving to Google Groups.  See the <a href="maillist.php">mail list page</a> for the new addresses and links.</li><p>

<li><i>(14-May-2009)</i> <b>wxPython 2.8.10.1</b> This release fixes the problem with using Python 2.6's default manifest, and updates wxcairo to work with the latest PyCairo.  </li><p>

<li><i>(16-Feb-2009)</i> <b>wxPython 2.8.9.2</b> This release adds the wx.lib.agw package, adds an event watcher to the widget inspection tool, and fixes a bunch of bugs.  </li><p>

<li><i>(18-July-2008)</i> <b>wxPython 2.8.8.1</b> This is a minor bugfix release with several fixes for problems discovered in the 2.8.8.0 release.
<p>


<li><i>(23-June-2008)</i> <b>wxPython 2.8.8.0</b>  This release had a number of
further refinements and enhancements on the stable 2.8 source tree
since the previous release.   On Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard) the Python
2.5 binaries of wxPython are able to be used with either Apple's
system Python, or with the Python.org version. <p>

<li><i>(29-Nov-2007)</i> <b>wxPython 2.8.7.1</b>  This release has had some bugs
fixed, some minor patches applied, and also incorporates the Google
Summer of Code 2007 version of XRCed, and adds the Editra source code
editor.
<p>
<b>NOTE</b>: On Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard) the Python 2.5 binaries of wxPython expect to be used with the user-installed version of <a href="http://python.org/download/">MacPython</a>, <b><i>not</i></b> the Apple installed version. A fix for this issue is being worked on for the next release. In the meantime you can either install MacPython 2.5.1 and adjust your paths so that that Python is used, or you can stick with Apple's Python and the wxPython 2.8.4.0 that comes with Leopard.

<p><li><i>(26-Oct-2007)</i> <b>wxPython 2.8.6.1</b>  This release has some important bug fixes and is a general improvement over 2.8.6.0.

<p><li><i>(27-Sept-2007)</i> <b>wxPython 2.8.6.0</b>  This release is mostly about fixing a number of bugs and inconsistencies in wxWidgets and wxPython.  

     
<p><li><i>(13-Sept-2007)</i> The <b>mail lists are up</b> and are working on processing all the queued messages.  This was definitely a "when it rains it pours" kind of situation, see the <a href="http://dotsrc.org/news/">DotSrc news archive</a> for more details.

<p><li><i>(10-Sept-2007)</i> Yes, the <b>mail lists are down</b> and have been since the 8th.  There were multiple disk failures in RAID5 array of the machine that <a href="http://dotsrc.org/">hosts</a> the mail lists.  The hardware has been replaced and data is being restored from tape backups.
     
<p><li><i>(8-Aug-2007)</i> <b>wxPython 2.8.4.2</b> This release includes several fixes and a few additions and improvements, as well as new build features for <a href="http://wiki.wxpython.org/InstallingOnUbuntuOrDebian">Debian/Ubuntu</a> and OS X.
  
<p><li><i>(14-May-2007)</i> <b>wxPython 2.8.4.0</b>  lots of updates, fixes and improvements.

<p><li><i>(22-Mar-2007)</i> <b>wxPython 2.8.3.0</b> This release includes a number of bug fixes and also some new enhancements, including updates to the XRCed tool and the new InspectionTool.  

<p><li><i>(20-Jan-2007)</i> <b>wxPython 2.8.1.1</b>  This release adds a few minor enhancements and a number of bug fixes designed to further stabalize
the 2.8.x release series.

 
<p><li><i>(11-Dec-2006)</i> The wxPython reference docs have been put on a server that doesn't choke on large files like this one does.  You can now access the <a href="http://wxpython.wxcommunity.com/docs/api/"><b>API docs</b></a> at <a href="http://wxcommunity.com/">wxCommunity</a>.  Please update your bookmarks.  As always you can also <a href="download.php#documentation">download a tarball</a> containing the html files to access locally if you wish.

<p><li><i>(11-Dec-2006)</i> <b>wxPython 2.8.0.1</b> has been released.  This is the first in a new <a href="http://wiki.wxpython.org/index.cgi/ReleaseSeries">stable release series</a>, and includes a few new widget classes and other enhancements since 2.7.2.  

<p><li><i>(7-Nov-2006)</i> <b>wxPython 2.7.2.0</b> has been released.  This is expected to be the last stepping stone in the path to the next stable release series, 2.8.x.  We're driving full speed ahead in order to get 2.8.0 included with OSX 10.5, and so far we are very close to being on schedule.  This release has some house-keeping style changes, as well as some user-contributed patches and also the usual crop of bug fixes.  

<p><li><i>(26-Oct-2006)</i> <b>wxPython 2.7.1.3</b> has been released.  This is another quick turn-around bug-fix release. 

<p><li><i>(21-Oct-2006)</i> <b>wxPython 2.7.1.2</b> has been released.  This is bug-fix release meant to resolve some issues discovered in the 2.7.1.1 release.

<p><li><i>(18-Oct-2006)</i> <b>wxPython 2.7.1.1</b> has been released.  This is the first official release of the 2.7 development branch.  Lots of new features have been added, and some existing things have changed (but mostly in backwards compatible ways.) 

<p><li><i>(15-July-2006)</i> <b>wxPython 2.6.3.3</b> has been <a href="download-2.6.3.3.php">released</a>. This is mostly a bugfix release.  

<p><li>A snapshot of the new style wxPython reference docs is available <a href="docs/api/">here</a>.  While most of the content is not yet present, the docs are still usable, and in fact helpful since they already accurately document what classes and methods are present in wxPython and what the parameter names are.
